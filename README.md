The Gives is a pretty simple web app that lets you watch YouTube videos with your friends, while video chatting with them.

Go to https://the.gives, paste a YouTube URL, share the magin link with a friend, once they join the room you'll both watch the video (in sync) while video chatting with one another.

You can also use [The Gives' Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/njkgkdbagmmjjahkpdhjfcmaildijnjb) ([source](https://github.com/dutzi/the-gives-chrome-extension)), which will create a room for you directly from YouTube.
