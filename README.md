[The Gives](https://the.gives) is a pretty simple web app that lets you watch YouTube videos with your friends, while video chatting with them.

Visit [The Gives](https://the.gives), paste a YouTube URL, you will the get a magic link, share it with a friend, once they join the room you'll both watch the video (in sync) while video chatting with one another.

You can also use [The Gives' Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/njkgkdbagmmjjahkpdhjfcmaildijnjb) ([source](https://github.com/dutzi/the-gives-chrome-extension)), which will create a room for you directly from YouTube.
